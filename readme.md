Your task is to create a basic ETL service which allows you to process files with payment transactions that different users save in the specific folder (A) on the disk (the path must be specified in the config). Users can save files at any time and you have to process them immediately. A file can be either in TXT or CSV format (for CSV you need to skip the first line with headers) with the following content:
<first_name: string>, <last_name: string>, <address: string>, <payment: decimal>, <date: date>, <account_number: long>, <service: string>
Example (raw_data.txt):
John, Doe, “Lviv, Kleparivska 35, 4”, 500.0, 2022-27-01, 1234567, Water
Mike, Wiksen, “Lviv, Kleparivska 40, 1”, 720.0, 2022-27-05, 7654321, Heat
Nick, Potter, “Lviv, Gorodotska 120, 3”, 880.0, 2022-25-03, “3334444”, Parking
Luke Pan,, “Lviv, Gorodotska 120, 5”, 40.0, 2022-12-07, 2222111, Gas

Process flow:

1. Read. The file can have tons of lines so think about the efficiency of your solution. Keep in
   mind that immediate processing brings a lot of value to the customer (try to avoid delays
   between processing files).
2. Validate. Keep in mind that there can be other files in the folder (A). Ignore everything except
   TXT and CSV. File name does not matter. Every line in the file may have errors (missing values
   or invalid types) so ignore those lines. Count all invalid lines and files, and write them down in
   the “meta.log” file.
3. Transform. To process the file you need to produce the result in a specified format.
   [{
   "city": "string",
   "services": [{
   "name": "string",
   "payers": [{
   "name": "string",
   "payment": "decimal",
   "date": "date",
   "account_number": "long"
   }],
   "total": "decimal"
   }],
   "total": "decimal"
   }]
4. Save. When the file is processed the service should save the results in a separate folder (B)
   (the path must be specified in the config) in a subfolder (C) with the current date (i.g.
   09-21-2022). As a file name you can use “output” + today’s current file number + “.json”
   At the end of the day (midnight) the service should store in the subfolder (C) a file called
   “meta.log”. The file should have the following structure:
   parsed_files: N
   parsed_lines: K
   found_errors: Z
   invalid_files: [path1, path2, path3]
   The service can be either a windows service or a simple CLI tool with start/reset/stop
   commands. Try to extract business logic from the presentation layer. Do not start the service if
   the config file is not available or empty. A service should have graceful shutdown. Meaning you
   need to handle all errors and show the information in the log (choose between console and file).
   As a result you will have the following structure on a disk:
   folder_a/
   source1.txt
   source2.csv
   source3.csv
   source4.txt
   folder_b/
   09-21-2022/
   meta.log
   output1.json
   output2.json
   05-19-2022/
   meta.log
   output1.json
   08-07-2022/
   meta.log
   output1.json
   Acceptance Criteria:
5. Use appropriate data structures (List, Dictionary, your own classes)
6. Design your input / output models (do not just handle strings)
7. Try to apply any Design Patterns you know (e.g. Factory, Builder, Strategy, etc)
8. Follow SOLID principles whenever possible
9. You can use any 3rd-party tool to process the file
10. Prefer using LINQ over loops
11. Use concurrent processing whenever possible
    Another skill you should practice is working with Git and Github. Implement the following git
    requirements while working on the task:
12. Make at least 3 commits
13. Push commits to the develop branch to your Github repository
14. When finished, create a pull request to the master branch
15. Try several git commands
    a.
    See commit log
    b.
    See diff between commits
    c.
    Make some code changes and see git status
    d.
    Perform reset --hard
